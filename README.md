# TweetbotOAuth

Quick tweak to keep using Tweetbot with own API Keys. Go to Settings and long press on your account to input keys or compile it for yourself with your keys already in it.

# Limitations
Since Tweetbot is using v1.1 and v2 API calls you will need to have Keys that still allow v1.1 API calls as well as v2 calss for everything to function. <br> Extracting and using the keys from the official Twitter app is an option but not everything works with it, as apparently official clients don't have to access to the full API (for example messages don't work with it).

Your account also needs to already be setup in Tweetbot, since this tweak just hooks the URL request to the API and adding accounts is not possible.

Notifications don't work and currently just supports 1 account.
